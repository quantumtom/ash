# Bootstrap through Handlebars via RequireJS

A demonstration of how to render Bootstrap components onto Handlebars templates using the RequireJS loader.

## Description

I wanted to find a way to load Bootstrap templates using Handlebars, ideally doing so with RequireJS. These solutions all seemed to incorporate Backbone or some other off-the-shelf MVC/P framework. I wanted to do all that, but without using a third-party MVC framework.

It took a few hours, but I was finally able to implement that formula using a [RequireJS Handlebars plugin](https://github.com/jfparadis/requirejs-handlebars) authored by [Jean-Francois Paradis](http://www.jeanfrancoisparadis.com/).

## Credits

I configured Bootstrap to load widgets using CSS themes from [Bootswatch](http://www.bootswatch.com).

I implemented an MVC pattern based on the tutorial created by [Jonathan Verrecchia](http://verekia.com/requirejs/build-simple-client-side-mvc-app-require-js/).
